#Checkers-and-Chess
Checkers and Chess (Doggos Edition)

The concept is checkers and chess with doggos instead of regular game pieces. The code was refined and debugged from an old high school partner project for just checkers with some bugs relating promoting pieces. Additionally, a button was necessary to toggle alternation of turn and the GUI was a 1000 pixels square which is not compatible with different screens and resolutions.

The current code has a fullscreen GUI with the ability to switch between checkers and chess and automatic alternating turn with consecutive jumps (a piece can jump multiple times in one turn if it can). All known bugs are fixed and chess is in the progress of being implemented.

Code can be found in the "src" folder.

Images used for the pieces can be found in the "images" folder.

Project progress / TODO list / known bugs can be found in "Project Notes.txt".
