In Progress	Alternate turn! -> everything is good except for consecutive jumps for the promoted pieces
Not done	(Optional) Maybe limit and make sure a player have to jump if it is possible?
Not done	Chess stuff (this seems a bit far-fetch rn but we'll get there!)
In Progress	Comments and Documentation
