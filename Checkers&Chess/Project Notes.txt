TODO:

Organize this mess of a code (update comments/doc) + fix bugs
Alternate turn!
Better GUI -> how to fullscreen in scale with border for info
Chess stuff (this seems a bit far-fetch rn but we'll get there!)


Bugs!
When jumping over a piece to promote -> fails to promote
Promoted piece can't capture backwards
Promoted piece attempting to capture ("jump") turns back into a regular piece
Probably more big sad :(
